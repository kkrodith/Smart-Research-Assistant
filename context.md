TASK: Smart Assistant for Research Summarization

Problem Statement: Reading through large documents like research papers, legal files, or technical manuals is time-consuming. Traditional summarizers or keyword search tools fall short when it comes to deep comprehension and logical reasoning. Build a GenAI assistant that reads user-uploaded documents and can: ● Answer questions that require comprehension and inference ● Pose logic-based questions to users and evaluate their responses ● Justify every answer with a reference from the document Functional Requirements:

Document Upload (PDF/TXT) ● Users must be able to upload a document in either PDF or TXT format. ● Assume the document is a structured English report, research paper, or similar.
Interaction Modes The assistant should provide two modes after a document is uploaded: a. Ask Anything ● Users can ask free-form questions based on the document. ● The assistant must answer with contextual understanding, drawing directly from the document's content. b. Challenge Me ● The system should generate three logic-based or comprehension-focused questions derived from the document. ● Users attempt to answer these questions. ● The assistant evaluates each response and provides feedback with justification based on the document.
Contextual Understanding ● All answers must be grounded in the actual uploaded content. ● The assistant must not hallucinate or fabricate responses. ● Each response must include a brief justification (e.g., "This is supported by paragraph 3 of section 1...").
Auto Summary (≤ 150 Words) ● Immediately after uploading, a concise summary (no more than 150 words) of the document should be displayed.
Application Architecture ● The application should provide a clean, intuitive web-based interface that runs locally. ● You may use any frontend framework (e.g., Streamlit, Gradio, React, etc.) to build the interface. ● You are free to use any Python backend framework (e.g., FastAPI, Flask, Django) to implement the core logic and APIs. ● The focus should be on delivering a seamless and responsive user experience. Bonus Features (Optional but Encouraged) ● Memory Handling: Support follow-up questions that refer to prior interactions to maintain context. ● Answer Highlighting: Display the specific snippet from the source document that supports each answer.
